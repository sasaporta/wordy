Wordy searches a dictionary for words using a pattern you specify.

Use a question mark ( ? ) to represent any single letter. Use a star ( * ) to represent one or more letters.

Examples:
- d?g would match "dig", "dog" and "dug"
- d\*g would match not only "dig", "dog" and "dug" but also "dialog", "drag", "drug", etc.
- \*ab\*ar\* would match any word that contains both the sequences "ab" and "ar", in that order, for example, "cablecars"
